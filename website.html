			<h2>How it works</h2>
			<p>Our vehicles have sensors and software that are designed to detect pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles, road work and more from up to three football fields away in all 360 degrees.</p>

			<h2>Example situation</h2>

			<p>In the following situation, our vehicle is about to drive straight across an intersection with many other road users nearby, including a cyclist up ahead.</p>

			<p>Our sensors and software detect and predict the behavior of not only the cyclist, but of all the road users around us.</p>

			<p>We rely on 5 million miles of real world experience to teach our cars to navigate safely and comfortably through everyday traffic.</p>

			<h2>On the road</h2>

			<p>We’ve put our technology through the world’s longest and toughest ongoing driving test.</p>
			<p>Each day, our vehicles can be found test driving on closed courses, on public roads, and in simulation.</p>
