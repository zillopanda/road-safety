			<h2>Summary of Campaign</h2>
			<p>A summary of my campaign against running red lights is found<a href="#doc">here</a>.</p>
			<p>The original Google Doc can be found<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ysZhrrrnsylceGcxE9_Sh-Do8j9PMKmYsm45_aS6nxA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>Laws on the Road</h2>
			<p>Running red lights will get you an on the sopt fine of $500 and 3 demerit points. Provisional drivers, P Platers only have four demerit points a year so if they run a red light they have prettymuch lost all of their demerit points so if they even just forgotten to dim their headlights or forgotten to put them on, they have just lost their license. Also if they are driving on a holiday with double demerits, they have instantly lost their license. P platers are 4 times more likely to be pulled over by a police officer if they break the law.</p>

			<h2>Your Safety</h2>

			<p>On average 718 people die every year as a result of running red lights. 320 of which were inside the vehicle.</p>

			<h2>Other's Safety</h2>

			<p>Running red lights doesn't just put yourself in danger, it also puts other drivers on the road in danger. In 2017, 821 people died as a result of running a red light. More than half of the people killed by running red lights are pedestrians or cyclists that were all doing the corrct thing and following the lights.</p>

			<h2>What we can do?</h2>

			<p>Red light cameras are a new technology that is making our roads safer by catching the cars that run red lights because it isn't efficient for a police car to be at every set of lights. During 2015 in Nassau in America, they installed red light cameras at every set of traffic lights and for the whole year, not a single car ran a red light.</p>

			<p>On the other hand in Virginia, their red light cameras stopped working and when they did they saw instances of people running red lights triple!</p>

			<p>The best thing to do to avoid the deaths and injuries is just not risk it and if you're given the choice of slowing down or speeding up, pick the sensible option. It's better to be late than <em>dead</em> on time.</p>
